# Session Report

Turn a **Claude Code session log** (`.jsonl`) into a single, self-contained HTML
report so you can *see* what happened in a run — especially in the multi-agent
SDLC pipeline (`architect → spec-reviewer → junior-dev → qa → senior-dev`) that
the [sdlc-pipeline](../../README.md) plugin runs.

It answers, at a glance:

- **What agents ran, when, and for how long** — a Gantt timeline.
- **Are the subagents pulling their weight?** — a value/efficiency table and
  auto-generated insights.
- **Where did the review gates earn their place?** — every reviewer run with its
  verdict and a snippet of what it caught.
- **What went wrong?** — failed commands, rejected tool calls, failed agents.
- **What decisions were made?** — a filterable, chronological activity feed.
- **What was touched?** — tools used (with time and errors) and every file read/written/edited.

This is a Claude Code [skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) in the
`sdlc-pipeline` plugin: Claude picks it up automatically when you ask to analyse a
session, and `/sdlc-pipeline:build-use-case` runs it at the end of every pipeline
run. You can also run the script directly.

## Quick start

Run these from the project root. `SR` is this folder — in a clone of the plugin
repo it is `<clone>/skills/session-report`; an installed plugin lives under
`~/.claude/plugins/`.

```bash
# 1. Find the session log you want (newest first)
ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sed 's#[/.]#-#g')/*.jsonl | head

# 2. Generate the report (collapses idle gaps so short runs stay visible)
python3 "$SR/session_report.py" \
    ~/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sed 's#[/.]#-#g')/<session-id>.jsonl \
    --compact --open
```

The report is written to **`reports/sessions/<session-id>.report.html`** inside
the project, so it's versioned alongside the code it describes. Open it in any
browser — no server, no dependencies.

Or just ask Claude: *"analyse this session log"* / *"did the reviewers catch
anything in that run?"*

### Where are the logs?

Claude Code stores one `.jsonl` per session under
`~/.claude/projects/<slugified-project-path>/`, where the slug is the project's
absolute path with every `/` and `.` replaced by `-` (`$(pwd | sed 's#[/.]#-#g')`).
For `/Users/me/work/shop` the folder is `~/.claude/projects/-Users-me-work-shop/`.

## Usage

```
python3 session_report.py <session.jsonl> [-o OUTPUT] [--out-dir DIR]
                          [--context-dirs DIRS] [--compact] [--open]

  <session.jsonl>   Path to the session log.
  -o, --output      Output HTML path. Default: <out-dir>/<name>.report.html
  --out-dir         Report folder, relative to the current directory.
                    Default: reports/sessions
  --context-dirs    Comma-separated folders whose *.md docs count as curated
                    context in the Context-ingestion panel. Default:
                    domain,standards
  --compact         Collapse idle gaps in the agent timeline (recommended —
                    runs span hours/days, so absolute-time bars become slivers).
  --no-subagents    Report the top-level session only (skip subagent transcripts).
  --compare OTHER   A/B-compare two runs on outcome metrics (SESSION is A,
                    OTHER is B). See "Measuring whether domain & standards help".
  --label-a/-b      Labels for the two runs in a --compare report.
  --open            Open the finished report in your browser.
```

No third-party packages — Python 3.8+ standard library only.

## What's in the report

| Section | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| **Summary cards** | Duration, agent runs, tool calls, errors, rejections, issues caught by gates, tokens. |
| **Insights** | Auto-generated callouts: which gates proved their value, which approved everything (low signal), where errors clustered, the slowest agent. |
| **Agent timeline** | Gantt of every agent/subagent run, coloured by type. Bar width = real duration; green outline = caught an issue; red = failed/rejected; hatched = still pending. With `--compact`, idle gaps are collapsed but widths stay proportional. |
| **Subagent value & efficiency** | Per-subagent table: **model used**, runs, total time, average, inner tool calls/files/tokens, gate catch-rate, errors. Reviewers show `caught N/M`; a gate that approves everything is flagged. |
| **Review-gate value** | Each review run (`spec-reviewer`, `senior-dev`, `qa`, …) with a verdict badge and a snippet of *what it caught* — the evidence that the gates are worth their cost. |
| **Errors & friction** | Failed commands, failed agents, and tool calls you rejected (where the agent guessed wrong). Your list of things to look into. |
| **Tool usage** | Every tool called (top-level **and** inside subagents), with call count, total time spent, and error count. |
| **Files touched** | Every file read / written / edited across the whole run (subagents included), ranked by activity, with per-operation counts and how many were written fresh (no prior read). |
| **Context ingestion** | Whether the curated docs (`domain/` and `standards/` by default, see `--context-dirs`) are actually reaching the agents — see below. |
| **Activity feed** | Chronological, filterable stream: prompts, decisions, tool calls (with durations), agent results, thinking. |

## Subagents are included

The multi-agent pipeline does most of its real work *inside* subagents
(`architect`, `junior-dev`, `qa`, …), and each gets its own full transcript at
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`. The script
reads those too and folds them in:

- **Tool usage** and **Files touched** aggregate the top-level session *plus*
  every subagent — so you see all files read/written/edited across the run, not
  just the handful the orchestrator touched directly (e.g. 335 files instead of
  67 in one sample run).
- The **Subagent value & efficiency** table gains per-subagent columns —
  inner **Tool calls**, **Files**, and **Out tokens** — so you can see who did
  the heavy lifting (typically `junior-dev`) versus the lighter review gates.

Each transcript is matched back to its parent Agent call by prompt. Pass
`--no-subagents` to report the top-level session only.

Plugin agents are namespaced (`sdlc-pipeline:qa`). The report shows the full
name and matches review gates on the short name, so `qa` and
`sdlc-pipeline:qa` both count as the QA gate.

## Measuring whether `domain/` & `standards/` help

A recurring question with the multi-agent pipeline: *is the context we curate in
`domain/` and `standards/` actually being used, and is it helping or hindering?*
That splits into three layers — the report measures the first two; `--compare`
handles the third.

**1. Ingestion — are they read?** The **Context ingestion** panel lists every
`domain/*` and `standards/*` doc with:
- **Reads** — how many times agents opened it (across all subagents);
- **Informed** — the share of those reads that happened *before* the agent's
  first write (i.e. the doc could actually shape the output, vs. being opened
  after the fact);
- **Cited** — how often the agent's own reasoning text references the doc;
- **Influence** = reads + citations, and which agent types read it;
- flags for docs **never read** (dead weight) and **read but never cited**.

**2. Attribution — did they help catch anything?** When a review gate's verdict
explicitly names a doc (e.g. a `REQUEST CHANGES` citing `clean-architecture.md`),
that catch is attributed to the doc — direct evidence it earned its place.

**Is a doc too wordy / bloated?** Each doc also shows its **size** (approx
tokens), **read cost** (reads × size = context tokens spent re-reading it), and
**Value/1K** — influence per 1000 tokens of the doc, i.e. *value per word*. A
large doc with low Value/1K is flagged `wordy / low-signal?`; a lean, heavily-used
doc is flagged `dense`. This is a **signal-density proxy**, not proof: it tells you
*where* to look. Confirm by trimming the doc and re-running with `--compare` to
see if outcomes hold. (It can't tell you *which paragraphs* are noise — for that,
trim and compare, or have an LLM rate each section's actionability.)

**3. Effect on outcome — help or hinder?** Reading ≠ benefit. Proving effect
needs a **counterfactual**: run the *same* use case twice, once with the context and
once without (or trimmed), and diff the outcomes:

```bash
python3 "$SR/session_report.py" \
    <full-context-run>.jsonl \
    --compare <stripped-context-run>.jsonl \
    --label-a "full context" --label-b "stripped"
```

This writes `reports/sessions/compare-<a>-vs-<b>.report.html`: a metric-by-metric
diff (issues caught, errors, rejections, rework, tool calls, files, **output
tokens = cost**, context reads/catches). Green/red is applied only where the
direction is unambiguous (fewer errors/tokens = better; more doc-cited catches =
better); ambiguous metrics are shown without a verdict, because their meaning
depends on your hypothesis. To run the ablation: on a throwaway branch, strip
`domain/` + `standards/` (or a subset), re-run the use case, compare.

## How it works (and its limits)

The parser reads the JSONL event stream and correlates each `tool_use` with its
matching `tool_result` (by `tool_use_id`) to compute durations and success.

Four details that matter for accuracy:

1. **Background agents.** Agents launched with `run_in_background: true` (e.g.
   `qa`, `senior-dev`) return an instant *"launched"* stub; their real duration
   and output arrive later in a `<task-notification>`. The script matches the
   notification back to the original launch, so async agents are timed by their
   real work, not by launch latency.
2. **Injected messages.** `<task-notification>`, `<system-reminder>` and other
   harness-injected user messages are filtered out of the "prompts" feed so they
   don't masquerade as things you typed.
3. **Resumed agents.** When the orchestrator sends a correction back to an agent
   it already spawned (`SendMessage` to that agent's id: an architect revision or
   a spec re-review), that counts as **another run** of the same subagent. The
   agent id is read from the spawn's result (`agentId: …`), or from `resumedAgentId`
   in the `SendMessage` result. A resumed run inherits the subagent type and model.
   Its inner workload stays on the first run, because the resume appends to the
   same transcript and would otherwise be counted twice.
4. **Hand-back reports.** A subagent can deliver its final report as a peer
   message (a user event with `origin.kind == "peer"` and a `[Subagent hand-back]`
   body). Its `<task-notification>` then carries only a pointer ("delivered to you
   as a message"). Each run is matched to the first hand-back from its agent id
   that arrives before that agent's next run. That report becomes the run's result
   (the text verdicts are read from), and the hand-back time becomes the run's end.

**Verdict detection is heuristic.** Whether a review "caught something" is
inferred from the result text — formal tokens (`REQUEST CHANGES`, `NOT READY`),
uppercase severity labels (`CRITICAL`, `FAIL`, ❌), guarded against phrases like
"no CRITICAL issues" and adjectival "critically". An approving gate that still
found or fixed something also counts as a catch. **FIXED IN PLACE** means the
senior dev reported fixes ("I fixed", "Fixes applied", but not "Fixes applied:
none"). **DEFECT LOGGED** means QA passed the change but logged a defect. Issue
counts ignore HTTP status codes and section numbers ("404 problem", "§3 violation"). It's accurate on the reviewers'
structured output but can misread unusually-worded results; the on-screen snippet
lets you verify, and unclassifiable runs show a verdict of `—`.
