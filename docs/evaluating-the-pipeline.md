# Evaluating the Delivery Pipeline

A manual for figuring out **how well the multi-agent SDLC pipeline is working** —
whether each agent earns its place, whether the curated context (`domain/`,
`standards/`) helps, and where the run leaks time, tokens, or quality.

It is written to be used by anyone, not just the person who built the pipeline.
You do not need to understand the agents' internals — every question below is
answered from data the run already leaves behind.

---

## 1. What you are evaluating

The pipeline turns a requirement into merged, reviewed code through a chain of
agents, with two review gates:

```
use-case-writer    (author the use case)
        │
        ▼
   architect          → plans the change (OpenSpec proposal, design, spec, tasks)
        │
        ▼
   spec-reviewer      ← plan gate (APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES), then human GATE 1
        │
        ▼
   junior-dev         → implements the tasks (the workhorse)
        │
        ▼
   qa                 ← verifies against spec + tests (READY / NOT READY)
        │
        ▼
   senior-dev         ← final code-review gate, fixes issues, then human GATE 2 → archive
```

Each agent runs as a **subagent** with its own transcript. "How well is it
working?" decomposes into four concrete questions:

| # | Question | Kind of answer |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Does each agent do useful work, or is it dead weight? | Observational (one run) |
| Q2 | Do the **review gates** actually catch things? | Observational (one run) |
| Q3 | Is the curated **context** (`domain/`, `standards/`) read and used? | Observational (one run) |
| Q4 | Does a change to the pipeline (context, input format, an agent) make outcomes **better or worse**? | Comparative (needs two runs) |

Q1–Q3 you can answer from a single run. **Q4 is causal** and can only be answered
by comparing two runs — see [§6](#6-comparative-evaluation-the-only-way-to-prove-better-or-worse).

---

## 2. The one tool you need

Everything here is driven by the **`session-report`** skill, which turns a
session log into a self-contained HTML report. Full tool docs:
[`skills/session-report/README.md`](../skills/session-report/README.md).

Session logs live at:

```
~/.claude/projects/<slugified-project-path>/<session-id>.jsonl
```

The slug is the project's absolute path with `/` and `.` replaced by `-`
(`$(pwd | sed 's#[/.]#-#g')`). Each subagent has its own transcript under
`<session-id>/subagents/`, and the report folds those in automatically.

Generate a report for a run:

```bash
# newest session first
ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sed 's#[/.]#-#g')/*.jsonl | head

# SR = <plugin clone>/skills/session-report
python3 "$SR/session_report.py" \
    ~/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sed 's#[/.]#-#g')/<session-id>.jsonl \
    --compact --open
```

The report is written to `reports/sessions/<session-id>.report.html` (versioned
with the project). Or just ask Claude: *"analyse this session"*.

## 3. The three-layer framework

Keep these layers separate — conflating them is the most common evaluation
mistake.

1. **Ingestion** — was the context/work *available*? (e.g. was `security.md`
   read at all?) Cheap, deterministic, visible in one run.
2. **Utilisation / attribution** — was it *used*? (cited in reasoning; a catch
   that names the doc). Visible in one run.
3. **Effect on outcome** — did it make the result *better*? This is a
   counterfactual: **reading ≠ benefit, and a catch ≠ net value**. Only a
   comparison of two runs can answer it.

The report covers layers 1–2 directly. Layer 3 needs `--compare` (§6).

---

## 4. Evaluating a single run

Open the report and read it top to bottom. Each section answers a specific
question:

| Report section | Answers | What "good" looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Summary cards** | Scale & cost of the run | — |
| **Insights** | Auto-generated callouts | Read these first; they flag the obvious wins and smells |
| **Agent timeline** (Gantt) | *When* each agent ran, how long, overlaps | Work is progressing, not stalled; parallel where possible |
| **Subagent value & efficiency** | Q1 — who does the work, who catches issues, at what cost, and **which model and effort each agent ran** | Producers do most tool calls/files; gates are cheaper but catch things; every agent on the configured model (opus) — a cheaper model on a long-running producer can cost more, not less, by needing more turns |
| **Review-gate value** | Q2 — what each reviewer actually caught | Gates with real, specific findings (not rubber-stamps) |
| **Errors & friction** | Where the run stumbled | Few command errors; few rejected tool calls |
| **Tool usage** | Where time/effort went per tool | No single tool dominating unexpectedly |
| **Files touched** | What was read/written/edited across the whole run | Writes concentrated in the change's area |
| **Context ingestion** | Q3 — are `domain/`/`standards/` read & used | High-influence docs read *before* writing; catches cite docs |
| **Activity feed** | The narrative — prompts, decisions, tool calls | Sanity-check the reasoning where a metric surprises you |

### Reading the gate value (Q2)

A review gate proves its worth by **catching real, specific issues** — not by
approving everything. In the **Review-gate value** panel each reviewer run shows a
verdict badge and a snippet of what it caught. In the **Subagent value** table
each gate shows a catch-rate (`caught N/M`); a gate that shows `0/M — approved
all` is either downstream of very clean work or is a rubber-stamp. Investigate
which.

> Verdicts are inferred from the reviewer's text (formal tokens like
> `REQUEST CHANGES`, uppercase severity labels). They're accurate on structured
> reviewer output but not infallible — the snippet is shown so you can verify.

### Reading context ingestion (Q3)

The **Context ingestion** panel scores each `domain/`/`standards/` doc by:

- **Reads** — times an agent opened it;
- **Informed** — share of reads that happened *before* the agent's first write
  (so the doc could actually shape the output);
- **Cited** — times the agent's own reasoning referenced the doc;
- **Influence** = reads + citations;
- flags for **never read** (dead weight) and **read but never cited** (opened,
  but did it change anything?).

**Catches attributed to a doc** are the strongest single-run signal of value: a
`REQUEST CHANGES` that cites `clean-architecture.md` is direct evidence that
document earned its place.

**Is a doc too wordy / bloated?** The panel also shows each doc's **size**
(approx tokens), **read cost** (reads × size — the context tokens spent
re-reading it), and **Value/1K** = influence per 1000 tokens, i.e. *value per
word*. Docs are flagged `dense` (lean, heavily used) or `wordy / low-signal?`
(large, rarely used). Treat Value/1K as a **proxy that tells you where to look**,
not a verdict: a low score means "candidate to trim", which you then confirm with
an ablation (§6). It cannot tell you *which paragraphs* are noise — for that,
either trim the suspect sections and `--compare`, or have an LLM rate each
section's actionability against how agents actually used it.

> `CLAUDE.md` is always in every agent's context and is **not** counted as a
> read. A doc showing "never read" may still be reaching agents via the summary
> in `CLAUDE.md`.

## 5. The question → answer cheat sheet

| You want to know… | Look at… |
|---|---|
| Is `junior-dev` (or any agent) actually doing the work? | Subagent value table — tool calls / files / tokens per agent |
| Is a review gate worth keeping? | Review-gate value + its catch-rate in the value table |
| Did the reviewers catch standards violations specifically? | Context ingestion → "catches citing a doc" |
| Which standard/domain doc pulls its weight? | Context ingestion → Influence column |
| Which doc is ignored? | Context ingestion → never-read / read-but-never-cited flags |
| Where did the run waste time or error out? | Errors & friction; Tool usage (total time) |
| Was the plan wrong (lots of rework)? | Count of `REQUEST CHANGES` / `FAIL` gate runs |
| How expensive was the run? | Summary cards (tokens); Subagent value (out tokens per agent) |
| Did I confuse the agent (guessed wrong)? | Errors & friction → "rejected" entries |

---

## 6. Comparative evaluation — the only way to prove "better or worse"

Single-run metrics show what *happened*, never what *would have happened
otherwise*. To prove a pipeline change helps or hinders, run the **same
requirement twice**, changing exactly **one** thing, and diff the outcomes.

This is an **ablation**. Do it on a throwaway branch so the variant never
reaches your main line.

### Protocol

1. **Baseline.** Reset the repo to the pre-run state. Run the requirement through
   the pipeline. Note its session id.
2. **Change one variable.** For a context ablation: remove or trim `domain/`
   and/or `standards/` (or a single file). For an input-format ablation: rewrite
   the use case (e.g. with vs without business rules). For an agent ablation:
   drop a gate. **Change only one
   thing** or the comparison is uninterpretable.
3. **Re-run** the *same* requirement from the same reset state.
4. **Compare** the two session logs:

```bash
python3 "$SR/session_report.py" <baseline>.jsonl \
    --compare <variant>.jsonl \
    --label-a "full context" --label-b "stripped"
```

This writes `reports/sessions/compare-<a>-vs-<b>.report.html`: a metric-by-metric
diff. Green/red is applied only where the direction is unambiguous (fewer
errors/rejections/tokens = better; more doc-cited catches = better). Ambiguous
metrics are shown without a verdict, because their meaning depends on your
hypothesis (see below).

### Interpreting an ablation

There is no single "score". Read the deltas as a story:

- **Stripped context catches *more* issues late** → the context was *preventing*
  defects upstream. It helped.
- **Stripped context catches *fewer* issues but ships worse code** → the gates
  lost their reference and are now missing things. The context helped.
- **Same issues caught, but full context costs many more tokens** → the context
  is *hindering on cost* for no quality gain. Trim it.
- **More errors / rejections without the context** → agents were guessing; the
  context was steering them.

Always pair the compare table with a look at the two full reports — the numbers
tell you *where* to look, the reports tell you *why*.

### Making it fair

- Change exactly one variable between the two runs.
- Start both from the identical repo state.
- Prefer the same requirement, or run several requirements and look at the trend
  — one run can swing on luck.
- Watch cost (tokens) as a first-class outcome, not an afterthought.

## 7. Metrics glossary

| Metric | Meaning | Better when |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent runs** | Total subagent invocations | Fewer, for the same output (less rework) |
| **Issues caught by gates** | Gate runs whose verdict flagged something | Context-dependent — see §6 |
| **Errors** | Failed commands / failed agents | Lower |
| **Rejections** | Tool calls a human declined | Lower (less agent misfire) |
| **Tool calls (incl. subagents)** | All tool use across the run | Lower for equal output (efficiency) |
| **Files touched** | Distinct files read/written/edited | Context-dependent |
| **Output tokens** | Generation cost | Lower for equal quality |
| **Influence** (per doc) | reads + citations | Higher = the doc is engaged with |
| **Informed %** (per doc) | reads before the agent's first write | Higher = context shaped the work |
| **Value/1K** (per doc) | influence per 1000 tokens of the doc | Higher = denser signal; low + large = bloat candidate |
| **Read cost** (per doc) | reads × size (tokens) | Lower for equal value = cheaper context |
| **Catches citing a doc** | Gate findings that name the doc | Higher = doc demonstrably useful |
| **Model** (per agent) | model that produced the agent's messages | Should be the configured model (opus); judge a cheaper one by cost per finished change, not per token |
| **Effort** (per agent) | effort level Claude Code recorded on the agent's messages | Should be the same across runs you compare; `unknown` means nothing was recorded |

Every retrospective records the model, effort and Claude Code version per agent in its front
matter, so you can compare across runs without the transcripts: `grep -h 'junior-dev:'
retrospectives/*.md`. Compare runs only when these match, or when the difference is the thing
you're testing.

## 8. Red-flags checklist

Skim these on any run:

- [ ] A **gate approves everything** (`0/M`) across several runs → rubber-stamp?
- [ ] A **doc is never read** and not summarised in `CLAUDE.md` → dead weight.
- [ ] A **doc is read but never cited** anywhere → not influencing output.
- [ ] **High rejection count** → the agent repeatedly guessed wrong; unclear
      instructions or missing context.
- [ ] **Repeated `REQUEST CHANGES` → re-plan cycles** on one change → the plan
      stage isn't landing first time.
- [ ] **One agent dominates tokens** with little to show (few files, no catches)
      → cost without value.
- [ ] **Errors clustered in one tool** → an environment or instruction problem.
- [ ] A **large doc with low Value/1K** (`wordy / low-signal?`) → trim it and
      `--compare` to confirm nothing regresses.
- [ ] An **agent on an unexpected model or effort** (anything other than the configured
      opus, or an effort that differs from earlier runs) → check the agent's config and the
      session's `/model` and `/effort` settings.

---

## 9. Limits & honesty

- **Verdict / attribution detection is heuristic.** It reads the agents' text; it
  is accurate on structured output but can misclassify unusually-worded results.
  Snippets are shown so you can verify; treat borderline calls as prompts to look,
  not as facts.
- **Reads and citations are not proof of benefit.** They are necessary, not
  sufficient. Only §6's comparison establishes effect.
- **One run is anecdote.** Wall-clock spans days and swings on luck; prefer trends
  across several runs, and lean on token cost over wall time.
- **`CLAUDE.md` context is invisible here** — it's always loaded and not counted
  as a read.
